    "# Data Science Assignment: Exploring Documentation and Data Analysis Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will explore three essential tools for data analysis in Python:\n",
    "- **Pandas**\n",
    "- **Matplotlib**\n",
    "- One more Python data science package of your choice (e.g., `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives:\n",
    "1. **Research**: You will read the documentation for these libraries and explore some new or interesting features.\n",
    "2. **Implementation**: You will demonstrate 5 different techniques or functionalities you have learned by analyzing a dataset of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. **Explore the Pandas Documentation**: Visit the [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/). Look for interesting or new features that you have not yet explored. Examples could include handling missing data, merging data, or using advanced group-by functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Explore the Matplotlib Documentation**: Visit the [Matplotlib Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html). Look for advanced visualization techniques that will help you visualize your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Select Another Library**: Choose another data science library you are interested in, such as `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, or `numpy`. Visit its documentation, learn something new, and apply it to your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements:\n",
    "- **Markdown Documentation**: For each technique or method you implement, explain what it does and why you chose it in a markdown cell before each code block.\n",
    "- **Code Implementation**: After the markdown explanation, provide a code block where you implement the feature with your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Dataset\n",
    "You are free to use any dataset of your choice. If you don't have one, you can download some popular datasets from websites like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or use in-built datasets in Python libraries like [seaborn](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/seaborn-datasets-for-data-science/) or [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/datasets/real_world.html).\n"

    "A gas turbine is a type of combustion engine that converts the energy from burning fuel (usually natural gas, but sometimes oil or other fuels) into mechanical energy, which can be used to drive a generator or other mechanical equipment. Gas turbines are widely used for electricity generation, propulsion in aircraft, and in various industrial applications."

    "Data Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ambient temperature (AT):Measures the temperature of the air surrounding the system. It's important for understanding environmental conditions and their effects on system performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ambient pressure (AP):Measures the atmospheric pressure of the surrounding environment. This affects air density and, consequently, the efficiency of processes like combustion and air compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ambient humidity (AH):Measures the relative moisture content in the surrounding air, expressed as a percentage. High humidity can affect combustion efficiency and system cooling.\n",
    "Air filter difference pressure (AFDP):Measures the pressure drop across the air filter. This indicates how clean or clogged the filter is—higher values suggest restricted airflow due to dirt buildup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gas turbine exhaust pressure (GTEP):Measures the pressure of gases exiting the gas turbine. It reflects the backpressure on the turbine and can influence its efficiency and power output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turbine inlet temperature (TIT):Measures the temperature of gases entering the turbine. Higher temperatures typically allow for more energy generation but require careful control to avoid material stress and damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turbine after temperature (TAT):Measures the temperature of gases after they pass through the turbine. It indicates how much energy was extracted from the gases during the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compressor discharge pressure (CDP):Measures the pressure of air exiting the compressor. This is a key parameter in evaluating the compressor’s performance and the efficiency of the overall cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turbine energy yield (TEY):Measures the total energy output of the turbine, typically used to assess its efficiency and production capacity over a specific period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Carbon monoxide (CO):Measures the concentration of carbon monoxide in the exhaust gases. This is a pollutant and an indicator of incomplete combustion in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nitrogen oxides (NOx):Measures the concentration of nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gases. These are harmful pollutants formed at high temperatures during combustion and are closely monitored for environmental compliance."
